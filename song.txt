No friends in the industry
My brothers been my brothers, man
You niggas ain't no kin to me, a fact (whoa)
Yeah, you heard about me, you don't know me more than that
Yeah, I know, I
Hey, hey, yeah

No friends in the industry
My brothers been my brothers, man
You niggas ain't no kin to me, a fact (whoa)
I was known for snappin' when I chat before the app
Stood on everything I said and never took it back (whoa)
No friends in the industry
I had to draw the line between my brothers and my enemies, a fact
Niggas love to start the beef, don't wanna keep it rap
Yeah, you hit us up and now we owe you something back
